Ideas:
- transform logs into images, then use CNNs for prediction, pattern/feature engineering, problem classification
- use transfer learning

L* gives 3 possible avenues for results:

1. DETECT problems in execution
2. PREDICT execution of current cases
3. RECOMMEND changes in execution

As our goal for this project we pick <1/2/3>, since <argumentation>.
